          Revitalising Traditions: The Stone Bakery's Journey into Home Baking
          with a Modern Web Presence
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Stone Bakery, a renowned business specialising in authentic breads
          and pastries, aims to tap into the home baking market by redesigning
          its web presence. Focused on a Dublin and national customer base, the
          initiative targets 55 to 70-year-olds who shop with mobile devices and
          have disposable income. <br />
          <br />
          The solution was to create a user-friendly website for bread
          enthusiasts to build trust and engage with the authentic bakery.
          Offering insights into the bakery's history, bakers, and reviews, the
          website enables users to purchase bakery products, access home baking
          guides, and book classes. Prioritising accessibility for all users,
          including the elderly, the site will be responsive on all devices,
          with a mobile-first approach. Useful tools like a Unit Converter and
          Shopping List will assist users in home baking.

          The bakery website design features a warm color palette, representing
          the bakery's warmth, with diverse colors reflecting product variety.
          High-contrast text and large UI elements enhance accessibility, while
          a friendly tone of voice communicates a welcoming atmosphere. Signika
          Negative, a familiar signage typeface, ensures readability, and

          The website adopts a mobile-first approach, catering to its target

          design process began with mobile devices and then scaled up for larger

          quantity of items in the cart. The cart also calculates the total
          price of the items in the cart. The cart was designed to be responsive
          and works on all screen sizes. An empty state for the cart was also
          designed to ensure that the user is made aware when the cart is empty
          and to encourage them to add items to the cart by navigating to the
          shop page.
